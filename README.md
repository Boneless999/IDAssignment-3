# Best Outfit's Ecommerce Website
This project aims to create an easy to use and aesthetically appealling ecommerce website for customers to view and purchase the goods offered by "Best Outfit". It creates a shopping experience that comes with the gamification feature of being able to earn rewards. 

It includes features such as a navigation bar to make it easier for customers to find the products they want to purchase such as "Backpacks" or "Shirts". It also has a shopping cart function to see the items the customers are considering to buy which also adds up the total cost of the items for the customer's convenience and transparency. It also has a clean design using lottie animations to make the website more aesthetically appealling.

 
## Design Process
 
 This website is for the customers of "Best Outfit" or anyone looking to purchase clothing and accessories and the Best Outfit's Ecommerce Website is the best way for them to purchase these clothing as it is not only easy to navigate but also aesthetically appealling. With the recent COVID-19 pandemic going on right now, shopping online is much easier and safer as well because it does not require any human contact. Moreover, it is much faster and efficient to shop online as you can just search for what you want to buy directly compared to shopping physically which requires you to walk to various sections of the shop to browse the goods which is not only more time consuming but also physically demanding as well.

- As a busy working adult, I want to have a easy and fast way to purchase new clothes for the upcoming Chinese New Year, so that I can impress my relatives.
- As a busy university student, I want to have a convinient way to purchase clothes and accessories, so that I will be able to impress my friends with different outfits.
- As an indecisive person, I want to be able to easily change and edit the things I want to buy, so that I will not need to walk around too much in a physical store have a dilemma on what to buy.
- As a customer, I want to be rewarded for being a loyal consumer of a brand, so that I can have discounts and perks when I purchase a lot of items from the brand.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
